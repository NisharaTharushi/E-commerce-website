## 🔧 Selenium Test Automation for "E-Commerce Website" ##

###  Project Overview 🌐

This repository contains **automated UI and functional test scripts** developed using **Python, Selenium WebDriver**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)** for:

🔗 [E-Commerce Website](https://www.automationexercise.com)

> This E-Commerce demo site is designed for practicing web automation. It simulates a real-world shopping experience with user registration, login, product browsing, cart management, and contact forms — making it ideal for learning and showcasing UI automation skills.

---

### ✅ What This Project Covers

I created **modular, reusable test scripts for each main page and functionality** of the website. Each script focuses on:

-  Functional testing of forms, buttons, and cart features  
-  UI element presence and validation  
-  Modal popups and alert handling  
-  Positive and negative user flows  
-  Page navigation and redirection testing  
-  Full test coverage of user registration and login process  

Test scripts are structured using the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for easy maintenance and code reuse.

### 📄 Pages and Features Tested

Scripts were written individually for the following pages and components:

-  **Home Page** — Page load, logo, header, and navigation  
-  **Products Page** — Add to cart, product visibility, modal behavior  
-  **Cart Page** — Product verification, quantity, removal, checkout modal  
-  **Signup Page** — Registration with valid and invalid data  
-  **Login Page** — Login with valid/invalid credentials  
-  **Contact Us Page** — Form submission and validation

## 🧾 Test Case Documentation

All **manual test cases** are well-organized in the file below:

📄 [`Test_cases.md`](./Test_cases.md)

This document includes:

- Input field validations  
- Modal handling and redirections
